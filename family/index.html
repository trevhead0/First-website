          <p>I love my little Adeline.  I figured if I have to
            talk about somehting and all of you have to read it,
             I might as well brag a little about my family.</p>
          <p> Currently she just learned to walk.  More of a wobble.
            For those of you who have my facebook(1 of you), then you
            have already seen her first steps about a week ago.<p>
